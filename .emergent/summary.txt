The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive task management application from scratch, progressing through several key feature additions. Initially, a full-stack MVP with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB was established, including core CRUD for tasks and users, and a robust UI using Shadcn components. Subsequent enhancements involved adding client and task category fields, implementing a complete authentication system with role-based access (Partner, Associate, Junior), user profile management, and a notification system. The most recent work focused on developing bulk import/export functionality for categories and clients via Excel templates. The engineer is currently debugging persistent 404 and 403 errors when attempting to download these templates, despite verifying route registration, authentication, and backend syntax. The primary challenge appears to be resolving routing conflicts or subtle backend misconfigurations preventing proper file serving.

The primary objective is to build a task management application for professional firms. The application needs to allow partners to track individual team member progress, follow up on incomplete tasks, and receive reminders for pending tasks, all through an easy-to-use interface.

The application has evolved to include the following functionalities:
1.  **Core Task Management**: Create, view, and manage tasks.
2.  **Team Management**: Track team member performance and assign tasks.
3.  **UI/UX**: A beautiful, professional, and intuitive interface built with React and Shadcn UI.
4.  **Client & Category Fields**: Each task must include client name and a task category.
5.  **Authentication & Authorization**:
    *   Different logins for each team member.
    *   Role-based access control: Partners have elevated privileges.
    *   Partners can edit tasks anytime.
6.  **Notifications**: Assignees receive notifications upon new assignments and task changes.
7.  **Task Details**: Ability to view full task details, e.g., by clicking on a category on the dashboard.
8.  **Team Member Profile Management**: Partners can create and manage team members' profiles, including setting login IDs and passwords.
9.  **Category & Client Master Data Management**: Partners can add, edit, and delete task categories and client entries for consistent data.
10. **Bulk Import/Export**: Functionality to download spreadsheet templates and upload filled templates for bulk management of task categories and clients.

-   **Fix Excel Template Download**: The current bulk import/export feature is incomplete as downloading the Excel templates for categories and clients is failing with 404/403 errors.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging the bulk import/export functionality, specifically the issue where downloading Excel templates for categories and clients is failing. The backend endpoints  and  are returning HTTP 404 (Not Found) or 403 (Forbidden) errors, even though the routes appear to be registered when queried, and a valid partner JWT token is being used for authentication.

Debugging steps taken:
1.  Verified that  and  Python packages are installed correctly.
2.  Confirmed that the backend  defines the template download endpoints.
3.  Attempted to resolve routing conflicts by reordering routes in  so that specific  routes appear before more general parameterized routes like .
4.  Removed duplicate definitions of the bulk import/export endpoints in .
5.  Tested with a fresh authentication token to rule out expiration issues.
6.  Checked backend supervisor logs () which confirmed the 403 Forbidden errors when accessing the template download routes.
7.  Confirmed basic authentication () works, indicating the general auth system is functional.
8.  Modified the frontend  component to address JavaScript errors, restarting the frontend afterwards.

Despite these efforts, the template download remains unsuccessful, returning 404 or 403, and the AI is re-examining potential subtle routing issues or silent backend failures preventing correct endpoint registration or access.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the  endpoint returns 403/404 by inspecting the FastAPI application's actual route handling and middleware.
